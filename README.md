# Pi-Hole-List
Script for merging hosts lists with excluding urls from whitelist.

As temporary - merged several lists and include some domains required blocking by my personal statistics, which can be added to hosts file to reduce ads and trackers in traffic

For now added the following to my list:

 - http://sysctl.org/cameleon/hosts  - Last updated : 2018-03-17
 - http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt - Updated: April-8-2019

since there is no https.
